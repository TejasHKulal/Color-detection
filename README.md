# Color Detection with Voice Output

This project detects the color of an object in real-time using a webcam and announces the detected color via voice output. It leverages OpenCV for color detection and Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) for generating the voice output. The detected color is also displayed on the video frame.

## Features:
- Real-time color detection using a camera feed.
- Voice output specifying the detected color using `gTTS`.
- Color name is displayed directly on the video feed using OpenCV.
- Easily customizable color ranges for detection in HSV format.


## Dependencies:
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- **OpenCV**: For real-time color detection.
- **gTTS**: For generating voice output.
- **Pygame**: To play audio generated by gTTS.

These dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
